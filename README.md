# TREE - Dashboard

**Tree-Dashboard** is a web-based user interface for stroke patients and their physical therapists.

The **front-end** design is derived from [SB Admin 2](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/sb-admin-2), an open-source theme for [Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).

The **back-end** service is based on Node.js and with the support of the Webscocket protocol and Redis database.

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

### Gulp Tasks
